Nevertheless, the tools supporting the design of EH-WSNs are limited to a few simulators that require developers to re-implement the application with programming languages different from WSN ones. Further, simulators notoriously provide only a rough approximation of the reality of low-power wireless communication. \r\nWe present SENSEH, a software framework that allows developers to move back and forth between the power\r\nand speed of a simulated approach and the reality and accuracy of in-field experiments. SENSEH relies on COOJA/MSPSim for emulating the actual, deployment-ready code, and provides two modes of operation that allow the reuse of exactly the same code in real-world WSN deployments. \r\n\r\nThe toolchain and software architecture of SENSEH is described in detail in our [IEEE SenseApp 2014 paper](http://disi.unitn.it/~raza/Papers/senseh.pdf)\r\n\r\n**The code will be uploaded soon!!!**\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
